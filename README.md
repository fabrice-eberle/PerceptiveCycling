# PerceptiveCycling

As a passionate cyclist and courier myself, I have often thought about how to better digitally detect dangerous areas to warn riders of unsafe routes or offer alternative routes and access more data in urban planning. The aim of the project is to develop an environment perception system for bicycles. To this end, video material from a GoPro camera mounted on the bicycle handlebars is to be evaluated using AI. YOLO is used for object recognition, e.g. for cars and pedestrians, while a segmentation network detects obstacles and the road structure. In the long term, the project could serve as the basis for applications such as smart city mapping, networked mobility or warning systems
